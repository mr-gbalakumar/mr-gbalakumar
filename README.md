## 💼 My Experience

I've had the opportunity to design and implement modern data architectures that support scalable data processing, analytics, and machine learning workflows. My expertise covers various areas of data engineering, including:

- **Data Ingestion:** Designing strategies to collect data from multiple sources such as databases, APIs, and third-party services.
- **Data Storage:** Leveraging cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 and Redshift to ensure high availability, efficient data storage, and retrieval.
- **Data Transformation:** Implementing ETL processes using tools such as Prefect and dbt to convert raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analytics:** Using business intelligence tools like QuickSight and Tableau to build dashboards and reports that provide insights into business performance.
- **Machine Learning:** Integrating machine learning frameworks (e.g., AWS SageMaker) for predictive analytics and model deployment, enhancing advanced analytics capabilities.

**Technologies:** Python, Prefect, dbt, AWS S3, Redshift, QuickSight, AWS SageMaker, Airbyte

I architected an end-to-end data pipeline covering all stages, from data ingestion to analytics and machine learning, providing an optimized and scalable data infrastructure. Starting with data ingestion, I designed workflows that capture and transform raw data from multiple sources into structured formats, then engineered a robust data storage solution using AWS technologies. Data transformation is streamlined with dbt on Redshift, ensuring data quality and accessibility, while orchestration with Prefect automates the flow for reliable processing.

To support business intelligence and machine learning, I integrated data visualization via QuickSight and initiated a semantic layer with Cube.dev for data democratization across teams. This architecture empowers decision-making, scales with business needs, and supports both predictive analytics and machine learning use cases.
