## 💼 My Experience

I have extensive experience in data engineering, spanning the entire lifecycle of data—from ingestion and storage to analytics and machine learning. Here’s an outline of my expertise:

### Data Engineering Expertise

- **Data Ingestion**  
  Designed strategies to collect data from multiple sources, including databases, APIs, and third-party services, ensuring data availability for analysis.

- **Data Storage**  
  Leveraged cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 and Redshift to ensure high availability, efficient data storage, and easy retrieval.

- **Data Transformation**  
  Implemented ETL processes using Prefect and dbt to convert raw data into structured formats for analysis.

- **Data Analytics**  
  Built insightful dashboards and reports using BI tools like QuickSight and Tableau to drive data-informed decisions.

- **Machine Learning Integration**  
  Incorporated machine learning workflows using AWS SageMaker, enabling predictive analytics and model deployment.

### Technologies

**Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, dbt, AWS S3, Redshift, QuickSight, AWS SageMaker, Airbyte, Lake Formation, Prefect, Airflow

## 📈 Data Architecture

In my recent organization, I architected an end-to-end data pipeline covering all stages from data ingestion to analytics and machine learning. This architecture includes:

- **Data Ingestion and Transformation**  
  Built workflows capturing and transforming raw data from multiple sources into structured formats. Data transformation is powered by dbt on Redshift to ensure data quality and accessibility.

- **Data Storage**  
  Designed a scalable storage solution using AWS technologies, allowing efficient data retrieval for downstream analytics.

- **Orchestration and Automation**  
  Used Prefect for workflow orchestration, automating the data flow for reliable and scheduled processing.

- **Data Visualization and Machine Learning**  
  Integrated data visualization via QuickSight for business intelligence. To support machine learning and advanced analytics, I implemented AWS SageMaker and initiated a semantic layer using Cube.dev.

Below is an architecture diagram to visualize the data pipeline structure.
